A production-shaped **agentic service in Java**: a bounded, fully reactive
tool-calling loop on Spring WebFlux against the Anthropic Messages API.
No framework magic — the agent loop is ~100 lines you can read, test, and own.

Most agent examples are Python scripts. This is what an agent looks like when
it has to live in an enterprise JVM stack: non-blocking end-to-end, retry with
backoff, bounded iteration, tool failures fed back to the model instead of
crashing the loop, and a unit-tested core with no API key required.

## Architecture

```
POST /api/chat
      │
      ▼
ChatController ──► AgentLoop ──► LlmClient (Anthropic, retry/backoff)
                      │  ▲
             tool_use │  │ tool_result
                      ▼  │
                  ToolRegistry ──► AgentTool beans (calculator, clock, ...)
                      │
              ConversationMemory (per-session)
```

- **`AgentLoop`** — the core: model → tool calls → results → model, until
  `end_turn` or `agent.max-tool-iterations`. Independent tool calls in a turn
  run **concurrently** (`flatMap`).
- **`ToolRegistry`** — auto-discovers every `AgentTool` Spring bean; unknown
  tools and tool exceptions become error strings the model can recover from.
- **`LlmClient`** — provider abstraction; `AnthropicClient` adds exponential
  backoff on 429/5xx. The loop is tested against a fake, so `mvn test` needs
  no key and no network.
- **`ConversationMemory`** — in-memory per-session history behind a tiny
  interface; swap for Redis/Postgres for multi-instance deployments.

## Run it

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
mvn spring-boot:run

curl -s localhost:8080/api/chat \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"message": "What is 973 * 481? Use your calculator."}'
```

The model calls the `calculator` tool, gets a grounded result, and answers.
Add a tool by implementing `AgentTool` and annotating it `@Component` — no
other wiring.

For token-by-token output, stream the final answer over SSE. Tool calls are
resolved first on the non-streaming path, then the last model turn streams:

```bash
curl -N localhost:8080/api/chat/stream \
  --data-urlencode "message=What is 973 * 481? Use your calculator." -G
```

Each `delta` event carries a chunk of the answer as it is generated.

## Design decisions

- **Why recursion for the loop?** Each `step` is a `Mono` continuation —
  no blocking, no threads parked, and the depth bound makes termination
  provable.
- **Why raw content replay?** The assistant's `content` array is stored
  verbatim and replayed, so tool_use/tool_result pairing survives multi-turn
  conversations exactly as the API requires.
- **Why error-strings instead of exceptions for tools?** A failed tool is
  information the model should reason about ("that zone id was invalid"),
  not a 500 for the caller.

## Roadmap

- [x] Bounded reactive tool loop with concurrent tool execution
- [x] Retry/backoff, fallback answers, unit-tested core
- [x] SSE streaming responses (`text/event-stream`)
- [ ] MCP client: mount any MCP server's tools as `AgentTool`s
- [ ] Structured output mode (JSON schema-constrained answers)
- [ ] Eval gate in CI via [agent-evals](https://github.com/hhagenbuch/agent-evals)
